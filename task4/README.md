# Task4 Calculator

## Usage
`php task4\index.php add \\;\\3;4;5`

## Problem
Support different delimiters
Add method should allow defining what delimiter is used to separate numbers.
Format \\[delimiter]\\numbers. To make it easy, \ will never be a part of delimiter.
Thus, following command is possible.

`php calculator.php add \\;\\3;4;5`

and its output will be 12.
